# PyEmpregos

Created to have an easier way to watch all job offers, in a single page, in the categories that I'm interested.

Right now this program retrieves jobs info from net-empregos and prints on the console  for the category that was selected  

**TODO:**
  - [x] Create a category list menu
  - [ ] Export to CSV (or other format)
  - [ ] Organise by category
